The Apollo program was the United States' human spaceflight program led by NASA, which landed the first astronauts on the Moon in 1969. Project Apollo was conceptualized during the time of Project Mercury and was realized after Project Gemini. In 1960, during the Eisenhower presidency, the Apollo Program was conceptualized to feature a three-astronaut spacecraft, and later was dedicated to Pres. Kennedy's national goal for NASA in the 1960s, of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth", proposed in a speech to the U.S. Congress on May 25, 1961.

The Apollo 11 mission accomplished Kennedy's goal when the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on the Moon on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module. All three astronauts landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969. Subsequently, five Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve astronauts walked on the Moon.
