(["Explain how Python's garbage collection works and how it manages memory."],["Python primarily uses reference counting to manage memory, which means each object keeps track of how many references point to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the memory is immediately freed. However, reference counting alone cannot detect cyclic references, where objects reference each other forming a cycle. To handle this, Python includes a cyclic garbage collector (in the gc module) that periodically searches for groups of objects involved in reference cycles and frees them. This two-pronged approach ensures efficient memory management while minimizing leaks."]),
(["Describe the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its impact on multithreading."],["The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This means that even in a multithreaded Python program, only one thread can run Python code simultaneously. The GIL simplifies memory management and protects internal interpreter data structures, but it limits CPU-bound parallelism. For I/O-bound tasks, threads can still improve performance by waiting on external operations. To achieve true parallelism for CPU-intensive tasks, Python programs often use multiprocessing or external libraries written in C that release the GIL."]),
(["What are Python generators and how do they improve memory efficiency?"],["Generators are special iterators defined using functions with the 'yield' keyword. Instead of computing and returning all results at once, generators produce values on-the-fly, pausing execution between yields and resuming when next() is called. This lazy evaluation model greatly reduces memory usage, especially when working with large datasets or streams, as only one item is held in memory at a time. Generators also improve composability, allowing pipelines of data transformations to be defined without creating intermediate collections."]),
(["How does Python implement object-oriented programming, and what are key features?"],["Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes and objects. Classes define blueprints for creating objects that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Key features include inheritance, allowing classes to derive from others and reuse or override functionality; polymorphism, enabling different classes to be treated uniformly via shared interfaces; and encapsulation, restricting access to internal state using naming conventions like single or double underscores. Python also supports multiple inheritance, dynamic typing, and runtime modification of classes and objects, making it flexible and powerful for OOP."]),
(["Explain Python's list comprehensions and provide examples of their use."],["List comprehensions provide a concise syntax for creating lists by embedding a for loop and optional conditionals inside square brackets.

List comprehensions improve code clarity and performance because they are optimized internally. Variations include nested comprehensions and using other comprehensions like dict and set comprehensions for similar concise constructs."]),
(["What is the difference between mutable and immutable types in Python, and why does it matter?"],["Mutable types (like lists, dictionaries, sets) can be changed after creation, meaning you can modify, add, or remove elements in place. Immutable types (like int, float, string, tuple) cannot be changed once created; any modification results in a new object. This distinction affects behavior in functions, threading, and caching. For example, mutable objects passed as arguments can be altered within functions, affecting callers, while immutable objects prevent such side effects. Understanding mutability is crucial for writing predictable and bug-free code."]),
(["Describe how Python decorators work and give an example of their practical use."],["Decorators are higher-order functions that take another function and extend or modify its behavior without changing its source code. They are applied using the '@' syntax above a function definition. When a decorated function is called, it actually calls the wrapper returned by the decorator, which can add pre- or post-processing. For example, a logging decorator can record entry and exit times of functions. Decorators enable code reuse, separation of concerns, and metaprogramming patterns."]),
(["How can you manage package dependencies and virtual environments in Python?"],["Python projects often require different versions of libraries, so virtual environments provide isolated spaces to manage dependencies separately. Tools like venv (built-in) or virtualenv create these environments, allowing you to install packages without affecting the global Python installation. Dependency management is handled via requirements.txt files, which list exact package versions. Pip installs packages according to these specifications, ensuring reproducible setups. For larger projects, tools like Poetry or Pipenv offer enhanced environment and dependency management."]),
(["What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Python?"],["Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, where each operation blocks until completion. Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently without waiting, enabling better resource utilization, especially for I/O-bound operations.
